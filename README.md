This is my first Project while studied at Ton Duc Thang university called:"AC DIMMER".
I used Firebase as a cloud-based for ESP32 to connect and send data.
Then i made an app to control it through Firebase.
I compile code with Arduino IDE, My code can run at both Hotspot and Wi-Fi connect. It has Wi-Fi scanning features, enter password to connect
